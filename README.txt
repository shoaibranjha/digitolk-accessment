There are many ways and approaches to write a code, The code that was already there was good as a straight forward code and itss good practice to use repository pattern.
I just make the controller a bit clean and make a service for handling the business logic, I used the SOLID principle for that with using interface for a Class, add some additional checks and conditions. I would love to write the test case but I can't due to lack of time.|
Thanks
